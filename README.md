## Loan Prediction Model and NEPSE Data Visualization Projects
This repository contains data science projects focusing on loan prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression models, 
as well as visualization analysis of NEPSE (Nepal Stock Exchange) data.

## Models
Three models are implemented for loan prediction:

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
A non-parametric method used for classification tasks, where the output is a class membership. 
It works by finding the most similar data points (nearest neighbors) in the training data and making predictions based on their class labels.
# Support Vector Machine (SVM):
A supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. 
SVM constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.
# Logistic Regression: 
Despite its name, logistic regression is a linear model for binary classification. 
It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class, which is often interpreted as the likelihood of loan default in this context.

## NEPSE Data Visualization
The NEPSE data visualization project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE).
By visualizing historical stock prices, trading volumes, market trends, and other relevant metrics, this project aims to provide insights into the performance and behavior of NEPSE-listed companies.
